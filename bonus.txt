For the bonus phase
I created a sperated end point called api/menu which returns the menuItems(itemname,price)
This I used in creating a select option of user where he/she can directly select menu item and quantity
And other feature I added is the ability of use to remove the item from front ent. I displayed the current orders and total in the form
of table and the user can remove an item by clicking the remove button as shown in the picture
